              "'england and scotland had the first leagues, but clubs sprang up in most european nations in the 1890s and 1900s, enabling these nations to found their own leagues. many scottish professional players migrated south to join english clubs, introducing english players and audiences to more-advanced ball-playing skills and to the benefits of teamwork and passing. up to world war ii, the british continued to influence football’s development through regular club tours overseas and the continental coaching careers of former players. itinerant scots were particularly prominent in central europe. the interwar danubian school of football emerged from the coaching legacies and expertise of john madden in prague and jimmy hogan in austria.\\n\\nbefore world war ii, italian, austrian, swiss, and hungarian teams emerged as particularly strong challengers to the british. during the 1930s, italian clubs and the italian national team recruited high-calibre players from south america (mainly argentina and uruguay), often claiming that these rimpatriati were essentially italian in nationality; the great argentinians raimondo orsi and enrique guaita were particularly useful acquisitions. but only after world war ii was the preeminence of the home nations (notably england) unquestionably usurped by overseas teams. in 1950 england lost to the united states at the world cup finals in brazil. most devastating were later, crushing losses to hungary: 6–3 in 1953 at london’s wembley stadium, then 7–1 in budapest a year later. the “magical magyars” opened english eyes to the dynamic attacking and tactically advanced football played on the continent and to the technical superiority of players such as ferenc puskás, józsef bozsik, and nándor hidegkuti. during the 1950s and ’60s, italian and spanish clubs were the most active in the recruitment of top foreign players. for example, the welshman john charles, known as “the gentle giant,” remains a hero for supporters of the juventus club of turin, italy, while the later success of real madrid was built largely on the play of argentinian alfredo di stefano and the hungarian puskás.\\n\\nbritannica quiz football (soccer): fact or fiction? how much do you know about the world’s most popular sport? from the fifa world cup to the proper throw-in technique, take this quiz to see how \"grounded\" you are in the sport of football (soccer).\\n\\neuropean football has also reflected the wider political, economic, and cultural changes of modern times. heightened nationalism and xenophobia have pervaded matches, often as a harbinger of future hostilities. during the 1930s, international matches in europe were often seen as national tests of physical and military capability. in contrast, football’s early post-world war ii boom witnessed massive, well-behaved crowds that coincided with europe’s shift from warfare to rebuilding projects and greater internationalism. more recently, racism became a more prominent feature of football, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s: many coaches projected negative stereotypes onto black players; supporters routinely abused nonwhites on and off the fields of play; and football authorities failed to counteract racist incidents at games. in general terms, racism at football reflected wider social problems across western europe. in postcommunist eastern europe, economic decline and rising nationalist sentiments have marked football culture too. the tensions that exploded in yugoslavia’s civil war were foreshadowed during a match in may 1990 between the serbian side red star belgrade and the croatian team dynamo zagreb when violence involving rival supporters and serbian riot police spread to the pitch to include players and coaches.\\n\\nclub football reflects the distinctive political and cultural complexities of european regions. in britain, partisan football has been traditionally associated with the industrial working class, notably in cities such as glasgow, liverpool, manchester, and newcastle. in spain, clubs such as fc barcelona and athletic bilbao are symbols of strong nationalist identity for catalans and basques, respectively. in france, many clubs have facilities that are open to the local community and reflect the nation’s corporatist politics in being jointly owned and administered by private investors and local governments. in italy, clubs such as fiorentina, inter milan, ssc napoli, and as roma embody deep senses of civic and regional pride that predate italian unification in the 19th century.\\n\\nthe dominant forces in european national football have been germany, italy, and, latterly, france;
